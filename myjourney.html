    <p>As a child I always enjoyed eating delicious meals. I had a big appetit and didn't care how much I eat. Also, I
        have a really sweet tooth.
        I can say that desserts are my weak point. I was eating big dessert after every meal. Easily I've got down a
        whole 100g chocolate bars.
        The heaviest I've been is 93kg(205lbs) on age of 14.</p>

    <p>But when I was 15, I decided to change my habits. Everything stared in the spring of 2018. First I quit sweets,
        soda and bread.
        I also started running. After a couple of months I've already lost over 20kg, and till the end of that summer I
        was down 25kg.</p>

    <p>The following year I started working out at home, mostly body weight exercises and exercise with a 8kg dumbbell I
        had. Also, I learnt a lot
        of things about nutrition. I found out about calorie counting, what I can say is the best diet plan anyone can
        follow. You can basically eat
        whatever you like and the only thing you should care about is hitting your daily calorie/macro goal. </p>

    <p>In september 2019 I stared going to the gym, and since then I haven't taken a longer break from the gym. Also, I
        started running seriously in 2022, and
        I participated in a few races. I've run 10km races and half-marathons. Currently, my best 10km time is 47:22 and
        half-marathon 1:50:19. Now I am
        preparing for a marathon in October 2023. If someone tells you running will kill your gains, don't believe them.
        You can still gain muscle mass
        with running on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>During the summer of 2021 I did a longer cut. I got quite lean, I was bellow 65kg, the previous year I was even
        lower
        body weight, I was 62kg (30kg lower than what I used to be), but this year I've built some muscle mass and
        looked
        better. Here are few photos of that.
